And <em>already</em> We had some experience on that(eh) at that time I was the editor of Dushu magazine we <em>organized</em> A series of <em>discussions</em> On... <em>These</em> <em>SARS</em> <em>Issues</em> So we suddenly realized that <em>when</em> These things came up... I thought I <em>really</em> Read that the <em>articles</em> At that 70 years ago I found a <em>lot</em> Of the similarities at the <em>beginning</em> Of course that(eh) there was(eh)(eh) we have not enough information... and we don't know what really <em>happened</em> And the Chinese <em>medical</em>...(eh) Scientists they had <em>done</em> some(eh) <em>research</em> And informed the WHO and other countries <em>however</em> In the public sphere was not we don't know what really happened there... So <em>only</em>(eh) the later I think after the mid-<em>January</em>(eh) there were <em>some</em> <em>Rumors</em> Of course that(eh) only spread over and(eh) <em>then</em> The people know <em>something</em> <em>Happened</em> Almost like a SARS we haven't not enough knowledge of that(inhalation)... And January <unclear>23rd</unclear> the central government <em>announced</em> The lockdown on <em>Wuhan</em> So... Because was <em>really</em>... Worried about the <em>spreading</em> Of the the the virus to other regions And <em>that</em> <em>Time</em> <em>Nobody</em> <em>Expected</em> That can spread over to the <em>whole</em> <em>World</em> This is a... Of course now we don't <em>know</em> <em>Where</em> the The the <em>real</em> Origin where it's from different sources is a <em>lot</em> Of the scientific work on that(inhalation)... But at <em>that</em> <em>Time</em> We didn't <em>know</em> So at the <truncate>f</truncate> in the first stage obviously a <em>lot</em> Of the(eh) the <em>angry</em> Is(eh)... <em>Dissatisfaction</em> <unclear /> so <em>quite</em> Is understandable and that time was very <em>chaotic</em>(inhalation) at the <em>same</em> <em>Time</em> Because the the rapid developments of the spreading of virus in that locality <em>no</em> Medical(inhalation) system can... <em>Support</em>... <truncate>s</truncate> These kind of the the(ehm) almost <unclear> afloat</unclear>  Right so this is a <em>very</em> Difficult(inhalation) so(ehm)... but the <em>second</em> Stage I think that the <em>gradually</em> They changed the <em>first</em> Of all you see that the <em>Chinese</em> Government especially the official media <em>folks</em> Are... That the <em>how</em> <em>Efficient</em> The build up to the hospital instead of the <unclear /> But <em>what</em> I... Can say <em>this</em> Is the... One <truncate>st</truncate> one part of the story the <em>other</em> Part of the story was... The <em>organization</em> Of a <em>lot</em> Of... <em>Localities</em> that the <em>two</em> Levels I think(inhalation)... First of all is(eh) <truncate>s</truncate> <em>self</em><em>organization</em> Together with the governments of course(inhalation)(ehm)... For the <em>self</em> <em>Protection</em> At same time that the more than I think the more than(ehm) 400(eh)... More than <em>40000</em> Medical workers were sent to the Hubei province... <em>Gradually</em> At that time I was in my hometown Yangzhou Which belongs to the <em>Jiangsu</em> Province... Jiangsu  Province sent 13 teams medical medical... Workers team to Hubei so when I came <em>back</em> from <truncate>Beij</truncate> to <em>Beijing</em> Because before the opening of of the semester(eh) I <truncate>th</truncate> the airport was <em>shut</em> <em>Down</em> In <em>my</em> <em>Hometown</em> But  so <em>that's</em> <em>Why</em>  I need to... go to Nanjing to take the <em>plane</em> To <em>come</em> To Beijing and when I was in the airport in Nanjing I saw <em>several</em> Embassy <unclear /> was there which was I was told that the <em>second</em> The <em>teams</em> Were sent to the Hubei so <truncate>th</truncate> they sent it to them so I saw those kind of things... <em>Happened</em> So what happened in China I think <em>two</em> <em>Levels</em>... one is the <em>mobilization</em> From <em>above</em> That without the(eh) the central government's <em>intervention</em> We don't know what will <em>happen</em> To even the second stage in <truncate>Hub</truncate> Hubei province <em>obviously</em> There was a <em>lot</em> Of(inhalation) <em>problems</em> That <em>inefficient</em> <em>Bureaucratic</em> And so on so forth... So(ehm) but(eh) but but on the <em>other</em> <em>Hand</em> I think is that <em>suddenly</em> That the <em>community's</em>... <em>Small</em> <em>Communities</em> Played a <em>crucial</em> <em>Role</em>... <truncate>i</truncate> in when I was I living in Yangzhou at that <em>time</em> <em>Suddenly</em> I realized that the <em>whole</em> that the district of the communities became a <em>real</em> Community... Before that and we lived there we don't know each other and nobody <em>knows</em> Each other it's like a <em>modern</em> City even if it's not big city suddenly the people were(eh) <em>organized</em>(inhalation)... And they check and they do <em>everything</em> And(eh) in to From <em>my</em> Point of... Observation at least in Yangzhou  And Jiangsu province it's(eh) to it's it is organized quite <em>well</em>(inhalation) so the Jiangsu Province <em>also</em> Had a lot of the(eh) the the infection in the the  people... But <em>no</em> deaths no single deaths even so <em>that's</em> Quite(eh) <em>extraordinary</em> For me other places so China... It's(eh)... The very <unclear>Divergent</unclear>  so different <em>regions</em> And even the different the local governments the <em>capacity</em> And the <unclear><em>studio</em></unclear> <em>Organization</em> The ways are <em>very</em> Different so that's the(eh) <em>two</em> <em>Levels</em> I think (Answer)        Question:        In(eh) in  Italy and <em>Europe</em> The pandemic is bringing to surface... <em>Some</em> Of the structural contradictions of our society and our system it seems to me that in a <em>certain</em> Respect the <em>same</em> Is happening in(eh) in China <em>too</em> Just to make an <em>example</em> the(eh) Hukou System so the the  system of <em>provincial</em> <em>Citizenship</em> So the fact that <em>access</em> To welfare(eh) is <em>only</em> In your birth province ok and with the <em>lockdown</em> This has <em>impeded</em> For instance thousands of migrant workers to have access to <em>health</em> Care So it seems as if the <em>pandemic</em> Is <em>emphasizing</em> Some <em>structural</em> Contradictions of our society <strong>what is your(eh) impression from...

{"text" : "what are the symptoms of(eh) decreased <em>oxygen</em> in the in the blood?    ","html" : "Answer:        Sure so...

But(eh) the virus probably originated in bats and and because of the(eh) <em>changing</em> Forces with <em>emerging</em> And <em>reemerging</em> Infectious diseases(eh) it found its way <truncate>i</truncate> into other animal hosts and then eventually into a <em>human</em>(Answer) Host and it probably circulated in an <em>undetected</em> Fashion(eh) for a number of weeks or or a couple of <em>months</em>(eh) before there were sufficient number of cases(eh) for <truncate>i</truncate> it to come to(eh) medical attention some people have mentioned the the(eh) the animal called the <em>pangolin</em> P a n g o l i n <truncate>a</truncate> as a possible intermediary(eh) host <truncate>a</truncate> as there were for some of the other(ehm)(eh) <truncate>s</truncate> coronaviruses and it is possible that that particular(eh) animal(eh) was(eh)(eh) a kind of a asymptomatic(eh) <em>shedder</em> Of the virus that was also it's a very(eh) it's an <em>edible</em> in the Chinese delicacy so it may have played a role in the initial amplification or <truncate>s</truncate> or <truncate>o</truncate> <truncate>o</truncate> of the <em>virus</em> Itself herebut but that role is(eh) still still being studied here right now the virus is a pretty... <em>Tiny</em>... <em>Particle</em> So(eh) when we think of <truncate>th</truncate> the <em>air</em> And we think of <em>dust</em> Particles dust particles in the air are about <em>three</em> <em>Microns</em> In size and the actual virus itself is <em>under</em> Or less than... One micron in size... We think it's really <em>zero</em> Point two five microns which is pretty small... so(ehm)... the question is how does this very small virus(eh) <strong>how is it transmitted?</strong> So... the <em>main</em> Means by which it's transmitted is by <em>aerosol</em>... Particles and... <em>Fomites</em> So <strong>what is the difference between an aerosol and a <em>fomite</em>?</strong> So when people speak when I'm speaking right now and people <em>sing</em>(eh) they they can <em>generate</em> Force from <em>inside</em> Their lungs and there's <em>small</em> Amounts of <em>moisture</em> That's from the(eh)  <truncate>v</truncate> virus(eh) <truncate>fro</truncate> from the generate from inside the <em>lung</em> And the virus kind of <em>hitches</em> A ride along these(eh)... water <em>droplets</em> And other types of particles that are <em>expelled</em> From inside the <em>lungs</em> Or from <em>breathing</em> Through the nose and the virus... Can then spread beyond the the individual <em>person</em> Now(eh) in general people have thought that the virus can <em>only</em> Spread about six feet and this is in our germ theory lecture as well(eh) six Feet is generally considered the <em>outside</em> Limits by which if you(eh) if you were shouting or talking that the virus because the <em>particles</em> Would fall to the ground because because they're attached to water vapor particles they're <em>heavier</em> Than the three microns in size and they'll fall to the ground so <em>most</em> Of the education most of the information and all the social distancing has <em>focused</em> Around this kind of <em>six</em> Foot radius now there have been certainly other(eh) reports of the virus(eh) being transmitted in areas that are <em>beyond</em> The six foot radius particularly(eh) choir type of circumstances or people shouting and there's a bunch of <em>videos</em> That anyone can find <em>online</em>(inhalation) That the virus can actually maybe be transmitted as far as 10 <em>feet</em> In some of these other forceful circumstances(eh) <truncate>th</truncate> there's <em>concerns</em> That the virus can <em>also</em> Spread or be <em>stagnant</em> In the air for periods of time that are <em>longer</em> Than expected and also can hence <em>travel</em> <em>Distances</em> That might be greater than the six foot(eh) six foot radius excuse me <em>six</em> And <em>10</em> Foot radius that we're talking about so this actually is is an important issue here so this is why being <em>outdoors</em> Is very different than being indoors because if the <em>virus</em>... <em>Lingers</em> In a circumstance where there's <em>no</em> <em>Air</em> Circulation the virus maybe can spread beyond that six foot radius <truncate>be</truncate> over the over the tincture of time that's there  and and that is probably true(ehm) again there's emerging information on this(eh) would have been <truncate>qui</truncate> quite upsetting if we thought this was the <em>primary</em> Mode of spread but it is likely a <em>small</em> Mode of(eh) additional transmission <truncate>o</truncate> of the virus so the particles are expelled and when the when the particles <em>hit</em> The <em>ground</em> Or they hit the table they're they're kind of relabeled instead of aerosols they're called  fomites f o m i t e s  they're they're basically the same kind of material... So the next question is <strong>if I <em>touch</em> A fomite am I going to get infected...?</strong> And the answer is <em>no</em> Unless you <em>also</em> Take what you <em>touch</em> And you touch your <em>face</em> OK more <em>specifically</em> Touch... The mucous membranes of the <em>eyes</em> The nose or inside the <em>mouth</em>...(eh) that's what you need to do with that particular fomite the the the <em>virus</em> Itself is not going to spread through <em>intact</em> Skin it doesn't <em>burrow</em> Through the skin like battery acid on the hood of a car you you have to touch it to a <em>vulnerable</em> Area and hence... we've why we've been asking people and for <em>any</em> Kind of germ theory you know <em>not</em> To touch your face on the average we talk about in my course people touch their face... On the average... At <em>least</em> <em>Six</em> Times... OK per <em>hour</em> OK which may surprise people but that's that's what the studies have shown so if you touch something and you touch your face or particularly touch your <em>mucous</em> Membranes(inhalation) then that's(eh) that is a small risk <em>clearly</em> The risk of the transmission in the(eh) in throughout the <em>world</em> Has been <em>less</em> By direct contact than it has been by this(eh) <em>droplet</em> Related spread or any type of airborne spread and we don't actually <em>know</em>... What the... the actual <em>number</em> Of <em>viral</em> <em>Particles</em> Needs to be to actually cause an <em>infection</em>... So I'm going to just spin this off differently for a second here we we have and we talk about in my course what's called the <em>stomach</em> <em>Flu</em>(eh) so this is what's typically the <em>norovirus</em>(eh) so...(eh) on the <em>head</em> Of a <em>pin</em> There's something like you know <em>10</em> <em>Million</em> Virus particles on the head of a pin and it only takes about <em>six</em> Virus particles to cause infection with the norovirus(eh) we we don't know what that number is directly with the <truncate>c</truncate> with the coronavirus is but the point is that <truncate>y</truncate> you might it might be you might have to have one <em>hundred</em> Or a <em>thousand</em> Virus particles to actually... get <em>infected</em> and and so  again that's that's another reason why <em>airborne</em> Or <em>inhalational</em> Infection(eh) is more prone to occur because there's probably a larger burden Of organisms and number <em>two</em> The organisms would go <em>down</em> Directly into the back of the <em>throat</em> Into the back of the <em>nose</em> or or directly into the <em>lungs</em> As opposed by the <em>other</em> Mechanisms by which you'd have to it have to be <em>touching</em> The nose or the mucous membranes and that's a little bit harder for(inhalation) for the virus to to take hold  in in people but I want to(eh) mention the... Actual <em>manifestations</em> Of the virus in in <em>people</em>... So(ehm) the <em>first</em> Thing is there are(eh) there are certainly people that have <em>asymptomatic</em> <em>Infections</em>... Now that's kind of an <em>oxymoron</em> Because if you think you have an infection then you think you're going to have <em>fevers</em> And all kinds of things that are going <em>on</em> <em>Runny</em> <em>Nose</em> <em>Stuffy</em> <em>Nose</em>... But... We're coming to learn that... <em>All</em> Infection of <em>all</em> Infections somewhere between <em>twenty</em> To twenty five percent of individuals have <em>minimal</em> To no symptoms and this is actually a <em>really</em> <em>Big</em> <em>Deal</em> OK this is actually a really big deal because... when we dealt with <em>SARS</em> And we dealt with <em>MERS</em>... Virtually everyone had <em>symptoms</em> and and and we could and one of the reasons we were able to <em>contain</em> Those other two coronaviruses... Is because we can institute <em>quarantine</em> We could lock people down for a short period of time... and(inhalation) <truncate>wh</truncate> when we knew they had symptoms and they would not spread it to others the <em>problem</em> With this particular virus is is that people can be <em>asymptomatic</em> For say up to five <em>days</em> Before they actually <em>get</em> Sick with the illness... And during that time window there's a <em>tremendous</em> Opportunity to spread the virus to others... and this... essentially we we know about <em>Lockdown's</em> But essentially limits some of the potential for <em>quarantine</em> to(eh) to be <em>effective</em> Because of this this large <em>five</em> Day window now <strong>what happens if you do get sick with the illness here?</strong> <strong> What do you what do you have?</strong> Well you're going to have a <em>fever</em>... Alright and by <em>fever</em> Which is technically defined as <em>greater</em> Than one <em>hundred</em>... Point four degrees(ehm)... so you're gonna have a fever and then you're going to have a a  <em>sore</em> Throat(ehm) and you may have... <em>Some</em> <em>Congestion</em> But <em>unlike</em> The <em>cold</em> Viruses unlike the coronavirus cold viruses... <em>Runny</em> <em>Nose</em>(eh) is <em>unusual</em> For <em>more</em> Than twenty four hours so a typical <em>cold</em> Or rhinovirus or even the coronavirus is a cause(eh) the <em>cold</em> Like... <em>Illness</em>(eh) will typically have runny nose for anywhere from two three four <em>days</em>... This particular virus seems to be a paucity Of(eh)(eh) symptoms that relate to runny nose and stuffy nose and <em>congestion</em>... Or(eh) that <em>initial</em> <em>Time</em> <em>Window</em> here... So having a a a a fever having a scratchy throat having an overall feeling of malaise and and(eh) not well-<em>being</em>(eh)... And then more <em>commonly</em> The most problematic symptom is... <em>Cough</em> And a <em>dry</em> <em>Cough</em>...(eh) and  and some to to go even <em>further</em> As the infection spreads into the lungs(eh) individuals can get shortness of breath(eh)... Associated with this some people describe the symptom as(eh)(eh) this old saying about(eh) if you're in a <em>pool</em> Too long you're you're spending six hours in the pool about... Being waterlogged and if you if you take a <em>deep</em> <em>Breath</em> You kind of <em>feel</em> Like your lungs are having trouble taking that deep breath since there's <em>infection</em> Or inflammation that's going on in the <em>lungs</em>(eh) as you might expect a <em>better</em> Analogy would be if you had a minor <em>burn</em> Injury or <em>sunburn</em> Or you you touched a <em>hot</em> Iron there's going to be <em>redness</em> <em>Warmth</em> And <em>swelling</em> That's going on there so if you <em>have</em> That swelling that increased(eh)(eh)(eh)... amount of fluid that's there you're going to have(eh) a sensation that there's <em>decreased</em> <truncate>e</truncate> <em>elasticity</em> of the lungs... One thing I I  will mention though that's important that I <em>didn't</em> Say regarding the <em>clinical</em> <em>Illness</em> So the clinical illness generally begins within <em>five</em> Days of <em>exposure</em> And people tend to <em>ride</em> This nice <em>wave</em> For the first three or four days... ok and some people ride the wave out and they ride out their <em>illness</em> But <em>unfortunately</em> There is(eh)... A percentage of the population maybe 10 percent or <em>15</em> Percent where at <em>day</em> Number... <em>Nine</em> <em>10</em> And <em>11</em>... This <em>oxygen</em> Saturation level may <em>precipitously</em> Drop prompting a crisis in their illness... so people are are are are <em>misled</em> In the sense that <em>hey</em> I'm doing pretty well I've had covid for four days everything's <em>fine</em> And then all of a <em>sudden</em> They're not fine OK  <truncate>an</truncate> and this is this is this is what people(eh) people need to <em>know</em> This because you're <em>not</em> <em>Through</em> This until you're probably through the eleventh or twelfth day of the illness OK and this is <truncate>tho</truncate> that <em>window</em> Period from days nine to 11 is an important window to have even <em>heightened</em> Observation of of individual(eh) illness            Question:        <strong>what are the symptoms of(eh) decreased <em>oxygen</em> in the in the blood?</strong>            ","meta" : { "identifier" : "COVID067q10", "type" : "open", "Overlap" : "False" }}

{"text" : "can you talk about that a little bit?    ","html" : "Answer:        (Answer)Sure so there's there's <em>two</em> Kinds of tests that are being adapted(ehm)... very well the the most important one is the what's called the(eh) <truncate>p</truncate> <em>polymerase</em> <em>chain</em> <em>Reaction</em> Technology or <em>PCR</em> <em>Tests</em> And we talk about PCR testing(eh) in my course... But(eh) it basically(eh) <truncate>amp</truncate> <em>amplifies</em> the amount of virus that's present(eh) until it can give a <em>positive</em> Result so... <em>Most</em> Of the(eh) the testing that's done where you see individuals getting(eh) something <em>stuck</em> Down into the back of their <em>throat</em> And tickling the back of their throat is this molecular(eh) PCR testing... Now there are a a number of companies that are also making... Tests that are available for other <em>portions</em> Of the virus... And some of those may not need to go into the <em>very</em> <em>Back</em> Of the throat they can go into the <em>front</em> Of the nose and they're <em>almost</em> As accurate as the PCR based testing(eh) and again if you <em>vary</em> <em>State</em> By <em>state</em> Here those those those tests are going to be... just just slightly different but those are definitely the most <em>reliable</em> Tests... There is also been a <em>saliva</em> Test that has been approved... This has to test for a <em>different</em>... <em>Particle</em> <truncate>i</truncate> <truncate>i</truncate> it's a <truncate>po</truncate> different <em>portion</em> of the virus <em>itself</em>(eh) Than... the actual(ehm)(eh)... The actual <em>polymerase</em> Chain reaction technology...  the the saliva tests are <em>available</em>(eh) but the difficulty with the saliva tests is that(eh)... you have to they're being <em>self</em> <em>Collected</em>... And they have to be <em>mailed</em> To kind of a <em>third</em> <em>Party</em> <em>Laboratory</em> And <truncate>th</truncate> the turnaround time for those those testings is... <truncate>t</truncate> taking somewhere between five to seven days but it is it is possible to do so...(ehm) the saliva test kind of came out... Before <em>most</em> Of the states really <em>ramped</em> <em>Up</em> Their testing capacities(eh) on a <em>local</em> Basis here so I think that those have become...(eh)(inhalation) <em>less</em> Important because we <em>want</em> <em>Rapid</em> Information... To try to... Isolate people and people are <truncate>re</truncate> are really positive(ehm)... the other <em>tests</em> That I mentioned  and and also has gotten a lot of... Attention in the <em>news</em>  is is something called <em>antibody</em> <em>Testing</em> OK So <strong>what is an antibody?</strong> We talk... In my lecture I think it's number <em>10</em> About the <em>immune</em> <em>System</em>... So when we have(eh)... <em>Germs</em> That invade our <em>body</em>... Our body responds with the production of... <em>Proteins</em>... And these specific <em>protein</em> Particles and and  molecules are called... <em>Antibodies</em> <truncate>a</truncate> and what they are designed is to <em>help</em> Our immune system capture and kill(eh) the invaders that come in so(eh) we do <em>mount</em> An <em>immune</em> Response to covid... The there are <em>two</em> Types of antibodies that are produced one is the <em>IGM</em> And what's called the Immunoglobulin M Class which is the first class and then the second is <em>IGG</em> Antibody that's produced... Now the IGM probably appears at day number <em>10</em> After... The clinical <em>illness</em> And then the IGG somewhere between 14 to 28 days... so(eh)... they're not these antibody tests are are really <em>not</em> very good to try to... Detect acute acute illness because it takes that <em>long</em> To <truncate>de</truncate> develop them where the antibody test might be <em>important</em> Is(eh)... Trying to figure out if you <em>had</em> An illness and you <em>didn't</em> Get tested particularly <em>early</em> In the coronavirus when we didn't have the availability of the <em>testing</em>(eh)(eh)... an antibody test might be useful also in in(eh) <em>population</em> Studies say in New York... Trying to get a <em>handle</em> About... What percentage of infections were really <em>asymptomatic</em>(eh) by estimating the the <em>disease</em> Prevalence by <em>antibody</em> Testing...(eh) we can get a better handle about how many people were actually infected... Now I will <em>tell</em> You that there is a bit of controversy that's ongoing with with antibody testing... and it has to do with population <em>statistics</em> So... If you <em>test</em>... Someone in a in a <truncate>l</truncate> what we call a <em>low</em> <em>Prevalence</em> Area where they where there's not <em>much</em> Coronavirus... And they have a <em>positive</em> Result... the <em>result</em>... Could be a <em>false</em> Positive test... so a <truncate>t</truncate> a <truncate>po</truncate> a true positive test is much more likely to occur... If for example you were dealing with a New York <em>City</em> Population... Or say a <em>Houston</em>... Population or <em>Austin</em> <em>Texas</em> Population right now...(inhalation) You were trying retrospectively to determine... How many people were actually infected... now you also may have seen a little bit of information on the <em>news</em> From the Centers for Disease Control last... Week about how there was an estimate... that... There could be as many as <em>10</em> Times... more <em>cases</em> Than we're actually... Figuring out by <em>testing</em> And that was based on some <em>preliminary</em> Antibody testing that the Centers for Disease Control had <em>done</em> In... Some of the <em>higher</em> Endemic areas... I I  think this <em>really</em> Remains to be <em>confirmed</em>... OK I think this was kind of a(inhalation) a preliminary <em>result</em>... and and I'm a little bit <em>skeptical</em> that that the number is as high as(eh) as as(eh) as as it is <em>ten</em> Times more more cases than the actual(eh) cases that are actually <em>detected</em> But(eh) again this is an <em>evolving</em>(eh) Situation here and and more remains to be determined on this too... so... what about you know <em>cases</em> I mean <truncate>yo</truncate> you can go to the <em>news</em> Sources on <em>TV</em>... You can go to the news sources in your state(eh) it doesn't take much to do a <em>search</em> to to find... The cases that are <em>ongoing</em>(eh) in the <em>country</em> And in the <em>world</em> The Johns Hopkins has a <em>site</em> Which is kind of one of the the <em>national</em> And <em>international</em> <unclear>Metrics</unclear> For the for the number of <em>cases</em> So(eh) I'm not going to go through all the population statistics but but certainly the United States is is <em>leading</em>(eh)(eh)... Many countries in the in number of cases the United States and <em>Brazil</em> are are kind of <em>one</em> And <em>two</em> Here at the at the present time and(ehm) but but the the <em>prevalence</em> Of the <em>disease</em>(eh) does vary very much by <em>state</em> and and <em>county</em> So I would encourage anyone that's listening here to really(eh) <em>look</em> More closely at their state <em>health</em> <em>Department</em> Site and look at their look at their <em>county</em>(eh) based information... I mean <truncate>th</truncate> that's the frightening part about what we're looking at now on the <em>news</em> Is that(inhalation)...(eh) you know it had been <em>hoped</em>... That as the country could <em>reopen</em> From its <em>lockdown</em> That providing these additional measures of <em>freedom</em> Would the number of cases would... Either stay the <em>same</em> Or they would gradually go <em>down</em>... But what's really happened is the number of cases has been... Going <em>up</em> I'm not sure it's been an <em>exponential</em> Fashion but it's been... Gradually <em>rising</em> And you know this is a... Difficult situation that we're that we're facing here right now you know it is <em>true</em> That we're doing more <em>testing</em>... But... that's not the only reason that we have more positive <em>results</em> We have a <em>much</em> <em>Higher</em> Percentage of <em>positive</em> Results based on the <em>testing</em>... So for example here in Wisconsin... in in my(eh) county it had been as low as three percent of all the tests that are done and and now we have more <em>positive</em> Results we're having kind of record numbers of cases but we're up to <em>10</em> Percent of <em>all</em> The people that are being submitted for testing so(inhalation) on a <em>national</em> Basis <em>yes</em> There's <em>more</em>... But the percentage has actually been <em>rising</em>... Not in every place but but in in in large centers so it's <em>not</em> Just simply we're doing more testing(Answer)            Question:        So Professor Fox another thing that you wanted to talk about is... <em>prevention</em> and and what we <em>can</em> Do or <truncate>wha</truncate> what(eh) <em>misconceptions</em> There might be about prevention so <strong>can you talk about that a little bit?</strong>            ","meta" : { "identifier" : "COVID067q13", "type" : "close", "Overlap" : "False" }}
{"text" : "Talk a little bit about <em>protective</em> <em>Gear</em> If you could    ","html" : "Answer:        (Answer)So... in terms of prevention medicines(eh) for <em>other</em> <em>Viral</em> <em>Illnesses</em> people have certainly touted... vitamin <em>C</em>(eh) and(eh) <em>zinc</em> Products for <em>reduction</em> And <em>infection</em>... And I get this question relatively <em>frequently</em> And I say that... <em>Hey</em>... if you feel comfortable taking those medications and there are some effects of these medicines on the immune <em>system</em> And you think that this helps <em>boost</em> Your immune system and it's not causing any <em>harm</em>... Then that's fine to go ahead and take it... The actual... <em>Data</em> On vitamin C and and <em>zinc</em> for preventing <em>covid</em> is is limited but again we're in a state of evolution of our <em>knowledge</em> Here... And you know it's possible that something like that could come out to be protective at some point in time in the future so as long as you're doing <em>no</em> Harm one of the principles for for medicine as long as you're doing <em>no</em> <em>Harm</em> Then I think that would <truncate>po</truncate> potentially be OK so <strong>where do we get into the...

{"text" : "Can you speak a little(eh) on the effectiveness of Face Shields?    ","html" : "Answer:        (Answer)(eh)so initially I I think as most people are <em>aware</em> There were <em>no</em> Recommendations for <em>wearing</em> <em>Masks</em>... In public either to <em>prevent</em> <em>Disease</em> Or to prevent the <em>spread</em> Of disease... and... That has undergone a <em>change</em> <strong> <truncate>an</truncate> and why is that?</strong> you know <truncate>th</truncate> This is again I've said it... Half a dozen times <em>already</em>(inhalation) this is a <em>dynamic</em> Situation and we're learning <em>more</em> About the virus... Each day... So(mh) <truncate>wh</truncate> what's <em>changed</em> About that is that this <em>twenty</em> To <em>twenty</em> Five percent <em>asymptomatic</em> Spreading... right and and if you think about the statistics... the the <em>mask</em> That people wear and we'll get into the <em>details</em> Of just a second here... if have the potential to <truncate>pre</truncate> prevent someone who is <em>asymptomatic</em> From <em>coughing</em> Sneezing and <em>generating</em> Those aerosols for <em>six</em> To <em>10</em> Feet... And also if they're in the <em>walk</em> Zone of someone <em>else</em> Who is in the asymptomatic zone it's going to reduce their chances of getting the disease so... I think at this point in time there's no <em>doubt</em>(eh) that masks <em>can</em> <em>be</em> Helpful in <em>preventing</em> Disease... Now <strong>what kinds of mask can people use now?</strong> There are a <em>variety</em> Of masks and <truncate>i</truncate> it's very clear that(eh) on TV you can see people with <em>hazmat</em> <em>Suits</em> On and those are going to protect you know to a <em>hundred</em> Degree a hundred degrees of prevention of getting the <em>virus</em> Here(eh) but the <em>next</em> Mask down is something called The N95 <em>Mask</em>(eh) and this is a special(eh) mask(eh) that has(eh) the ability to <em>filter</em> About <em>ninety</em> Five percent of all virus particles(eh)... and these are ones that are are <em>reserved</em> <em>Mostly</em> For <em>health</em> <em>Care</em> Workers again you can... Or potentially could have gotten them at this point in time or can gotten them from other <em>reasons</em> Here but these are the ones that the health care workers have been <em>clamoring</em> About that have been <em>short</em> and(eh) and and not having the ability to to protect them... <em>Now</em>... Some people may say <em>hey</em>(ehm)... you know you're talking about a virus that's <em>less</em> Than one <em>micron</em> In size and they're the the actual material that these mask are made out of particularly even the N95 <em>mask</em> Have... <em>Holes</em> That can... <em>Filter</em> Particles but only to a level of <em>three</em> Microns in size... So <strong>how is it that these masks have the ability to actually <em>filter</em> Particles that are less than one micron in size?</strong> And it has to do with the <em>material</em> that  the N95 masks are made out of it has to deal with <em>electrostatic</em> Charges that are that are <em>adjacent</em> To the material in terms of capturing the virus particles(inhalation)... And also has to deal with various <em>layers</em> Of the material that the mask are made out of... <em>Any</em> Mask will it be a N95 or or or a cloth mask... Is not like(eh) having some(eh) handful of sticks and then pouring some water on it where they where the water goes through the areas where there's no... Where there's no <em>sticks</em> Here <truncate>i</truncate> it's more complicated(eh) more complicated than that... So... The next kind of best mask that we have are <em>cloth</em> Masks now  these cloth mask have various <em>fiber</em> Fiber <em>capacities</em>... The closer together the fibers are the <em>better</em> Capacity the mask are going to have to filter the virus so it's <em>estimated</em> That... A cloth mask is going to have filtration deficiency of somewhere between <em>70</em> To <em>75</em> Percent in <em>preventing</em> The virus(eh) <em>transmission</em> From inhalational inhalational purposes one one <em>very</em> Important point  very very important point to emphasize here is that if you <em>have</em> A mask on you've got to <em>wear</em> It right OK...
